# OSP (Open Social Project)

The alternative Social Media Platform based on TYPO3

## What is OSP?

OSP (Open Social Project) is a TYPO3 extension that can *turn TYPO3 into a social network*. The idea is to create an independent social network in which each user takes over the hosting himself. This ensures 100% control over your own data. With OSP you are both a user and an administrator. There is no censorship and no annoying advertisements. In addition, *you can design OSP* much better according to your taste and create more complex content than on other social networks.

OSP uses a template that is almost 100% based on the Bootstrap 5 framework. All components used are open source and state of the art. This allows developers and frontend designers to manipulate the system extremely easily and adapt it to their needs.

# OSP (Open Social Project)

The alternative Social Media Platform based on TYPO3

## What is OSP?

OSP (Open Social Project) is a TYPO3 extension that can turn TYPO3 into a social network. The idea is to create an independent social network in which each user takes over the hosting himself. This ensures 100% control over your own data. With OSP you are both a user and an administrator. There is no censorship and no annoying advertisements. In addition, you can design OSP much better according to your taste and create more complex content than on other social networks.
